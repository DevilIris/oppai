.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
oppai \fIFILE\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
A difficulty and pp calculator for osu! standard beatmaps. It works all maps,
even unranked or unsubmitted ones. All you need to do is supply the map's
\fI*.osu\fP file.
.P
When FILE is \-, read standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.IB accuracy %
Set the play accuracy. The default is \fI100%\fP.
.TP
.IB "number of 100s" x100
.TP
.IB "number of 50s" x50
Sets the number of imperfect hits. The default is to assume every note is a
\fI300\fP.
.TP
.BI + mods
Sets which mods were used. When multiple mods are used, simply concatenate
their names, such as "HDHR". The default is to use no mods.
.TP
.IB combo x
Sets the combo. By default full combo is used.
.TP
.BI scorev "version number"
Use the given scoring algorithm instead of the most current one.
.TP
.BI ar "ar override"
Use the given base AR instead of the map's.
.TP
.BI od "od override"
Use the given base OD instead of the map's.
.TP
.BI cs "cs override"
Use the given base CS instead of the map's.
.TP
.BI \-st "max singletap bpm threshold"
This is used to count how many notes are within 1/2 singletaps of this bpm.
Defaults to 240bpm.
.TP
.BI \-o "output module"
How map information is printed to the screen, such as outputting JSON. By
default it is printed as \fItext\fP.
.TP
.BI \-no-awkwardness
-no-awkwardness: disables rhythm awkwardness calculation. since this is disabled
by default as of 0.9.8, this flag is only kept for backwards compatibility
.TP
.BI \-awkwardness
Enables experimental rhythm awkwardness calculations, ~10% slower.
.TP
.BI \-cache
Enables caching of pre-parsed beatmap data to the oppai_cache folder where the
oppai binary is located.
This usually boosts performance by ~25% on reasonably fast drives.
Warning: the cache files might not be portable to different machines and might
cause incorrect calculations if corrupt.
.TP
.BI \-no-cache
Disables caching. Since caching is disabled by default as of 0.9.7, this flag
does nothing and is just kept for backwards compatibility.
.SH RETURN CODES
0 is returned if the program exited normally, nonzero is returned otherwise.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
oppai "gtmn. (witch's slave) - furioso melodia (Alumetorz) [Wrath].osu"
